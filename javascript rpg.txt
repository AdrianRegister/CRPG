PLAYER STATS			   ENEMY STATS



enemies - levelled groups (0-5), (6-10)  etc. each group has stats chosen randomly within a range. 

combat flavour text - attack / defend / feint moves each connect with an array of possible flavor text lines. use random picker function from silly story generator to randomly choose an array line.

keep track of lifetime stats - total kills, damage dealt, damage received, etc

HUMANS objects - person (name, class, level, stats, equipment)
		>> enemy types(inherit from person) 		DONE
EQUIPMENT objects - gear (attack, defense, dexterity)		NOT DONE
		>> weapon types(inherit)
		armor types(inherit)

name = comes from arrays of first and last names, randomly chosen DONE
class = myrmidon, bruiser, defender, barbarian, hoplite. TO BEGIN: only myrmidon, barbarian, hoplite DONE 
level = this starts at 1 and updates when xp is gained IN PROGRESS
stats = object literal eg attack: 5 			DONE
equipment = object literal eg head: iron helmet (this is an equipment object) DONE

TODO - newgame function = click newgame button > empties innerHTML of main div. replaces it with: enter name, choose class, assign stats. when finished, main div is populated. DONE

create Enemy class + constructor. populate enemy window with generated Enemy instance. Use random numbers to choose class and stats of enemy. DONE

add buttons to show enemy stats and equipment. add a 'hub' to the main window. add hub buttons for different areas eg tavern, training pit, quartermaster, infirmary. add big button at bottom - 'next fight' DONE

create hub areas. flavour text for each area. Merge displayFunctions into one displayHubArea(area) function. AREAS DONE. FUNCTION STILL TO DO. 

start implementing combat system. attack / defend / feint, each with a percentage chance of success calculated by checking player's strength / defense / dexterity against opponent's.
attack = dexterity vs dexterity. attacks normally. roll for hit and apply damage.
defend = defence vs dexterity. doesn't attack. if successful, recovers a bit of health.
feint = dexterity vs dexterity. if successful, adds a modifier to next attack. IGNORE FOR NOW

formula to determine successful action:
number1 = random_number(1, 23)
        to_hit = number1 + char1_dex
        number2 = random_number(1, 23)
        defended = number2 + char2_def
   if to_hit > defended, ACTION IS SUCCESSFUL

damage formula
strength vs defence. 
random_modifier = random_number(1, 20)
damage = (strength + random_modifier) - defence CALCS AND FORMULAE DONE. IMPLEMENT INTO gameScript.js
