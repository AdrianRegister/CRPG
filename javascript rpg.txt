	attack = dexterity vs dexterity. attacks normally. roll for hit and apply damage. DONE
	defend = defence vs dexterity. doesn't attack. if successful, recovers a bit of health. IGNORE FOR NOW
	feint = dexterity vs dexterity. if successful, adds a modifier to next attack (critical hit?). IGNORE FOR NOW

	formula to determine successful action:
	number1 = random_number(1, 23)
        	to_hit = number1 + char1_dex
        	number2 = random_number(1, 23)
        	defended = number2 + char2_def
   	if to_hit > defended, ACTION IS SUCCESSFUL	DONE

	damage formula		
	strength vs defence.
