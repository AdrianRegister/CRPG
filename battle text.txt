Your opponent, ${enemy.name}, stands across the sand from you. Like you, he is a fellow recruit, and this is his first fight.<br><br>He seems nervous, and clenches his weapon tightly. You both slowly circle each other, neither of you willing to overly commit. The early afternoon sun hangs high above. The arena stands are mostly empty - there are not many people interested in seeing two novices fight.<br><br>Your mouth is dry and your heart is beating painfully against your ribcage as you take one, then two, then three steps towards ${enemy.name[1]}. Raising his shield to meet your tentative charge, the duel begins!
